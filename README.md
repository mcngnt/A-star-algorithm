# A-star-algorithm
 Implementation of the A* algorithm in sfml

## How does it works ?
The app uses a classic implementation of the A* algorithm for doing pathfinding between two targets (in red and green). The walls are represented by blue cells. The dark green cells represent the "open" set at the end of the algorithm and the red ones represent the "close" set.

## Controls :
- Left Click : put/remove walls
- Right Click : move target node
- Middle Click : move start node
